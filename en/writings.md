### [Intention Note]({{ site.baseurl }}/texts/intentionnote/) | The Hague, January 2019

*This is the text I wrote before I began my tree adventures. It was addressed to my teachers in art school and constitutes a sort of intention note for the project. It is also a summary of my initial goals and ambitions.*

### [Rue de Soignies]({{ site.baseurl }}/texts/ruedesoignies/) | Brussels, May 2019

*This text was written during the last days of my first arboreal experience, in Brussels in May 2019. It was first read in June 2019 at KABK, the school where I study in The Hague. Forced to limit myself to a twenty-minute format, I had to skip anything anecdotal in order to get to the essential.*

### [Île de la Cité]({{ site.baseurl }}/texts/iledelacite/) | Paris, August 2019

*I wrote this text in the months following my week spent in the willow at the peak of the Île de la Cité, in Paris at the end of August 2019. Here I took the chance to dive much more into writing, and expand on the themes that seemed important to me in relation to this experience.*
